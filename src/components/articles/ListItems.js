    description:
      "Weekly Meal Planner is one of the projects I'm working on at the moment. It is a web app using MERN stack that is in the early stages of development. \n\nThe idea is to create a meal platform that will allow users to find inspiration through content based on their interests and also create weekly meal plans. Users will be able to search for recipes, meal categories, and find inspiration for their dinner, lunch or simply a snack. I plan to add features like composing a weekly meal plan and the option to add favorites and browse recommendations. Users will also have the ability to create and edit their own recipes and share the recipes they create on social media. \n\nI am currently in the process of setting up the back end of the app and creating the structure for the MongoDB database that will store all this information. I would also like to build the front end of the project first and add additional features to the app for later development. In order to accomplish this I am going to create a backend API using Node and Express to handle the communication between the front end and the back end, which will also facilitate the creation of user identities in the database. The front end will be built using the React framework so I will be able to create reusable components for all the pages that make up the app. \n\nOnce I have completed the development of the app I will begin implementing it using Git to deploy it to a test server and start beta testing the functionality.",
