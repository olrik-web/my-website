# My personal website https://marcusolrik.dk/ 

This is my personal website which was made using React. It is constantly a work in progress as I try to keep it up to date with what I'm developing at the moment. 

It's a single page application which serves as my personal portfolio and a fun playground for me to test out different ideas.
